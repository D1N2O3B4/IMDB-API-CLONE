# 🎬 IMDb API Clone (Django REST Framework)

This project is a **RESTful API** built with **Django REST Framework (DRF)** that replicates core IMDb functionality. It provides structured endpoints for movies, TV shows, actors, and crew members, making it a solid backend foundation for media-related applications.
